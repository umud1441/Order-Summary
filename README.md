Hello. This is my first project on GitHub. I currently learning HTML & CSS and Javascript. I am focused on improving my skills and become a FrontEnd Developer. 

What did I learn with this project: 
* Improved my CSS knowledge with fully-understanding border-box and box-sizing property. 
* HTML elements have default property values, so I learned how to change those values.
* I improved my knowledge about margin, padding, background and border-radius properties.
* I learned pseudo-classes such as :hover. 

What did I use to make this project (not only just third party things but also which css properties that I used):
* Google Fonts
* :root
* margin, padding, border, background
* classes
* width
* variables
* overflow
* flexbox
* pseudo-class such as :hover

Which CSS Properties / Topics That I Must Studying in the Future?
* Display property.
* Overflow
* background-repeat

And by the way, I also learned how to use git and github with this tutorial video but the video has Turkish language => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7foV53lJhVQ

I didn't make any tutorial video but FreecodeCamp did. This is the direct link to the video => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR5GxoFhIAU
